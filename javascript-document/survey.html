<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This document is an introduction to the <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript">JavaScript Programming
Language</a> for professional programmers. It is a small language, so if
you are familiar with other languages, then this won't be too
demanding.</p>
<p>JavaScript is not Java. They are two very different languages.
JavaScript is not a subset of Java. It is not interpreted Java. (Java
is interpreted Java!) JavaScript shares C-family syntax with Java, but
at a deeper level it shows greater similarity to the languages <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/little.html">Scheme</a> and <a href="http://research.sun.com/self/language.html">Self</a>.
It is a small language, but it is also a suprisingly powerful and
expressive language.You should take a look at it. You will find that it
is not a toy language, but a full programming language with many
distinctive properties.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a regular language which won't take much time to
learn. It is better suited to some tasks, such as client programming,
than Java is. In my own practice, I have found that working with
JavaScript has made me a better Java programmer because it introduced
me to a useful set of dynamic techniques.</p>
<p>When JavaScript was first introduced, I dismissed it as being not
worth my attention. Much later, I took another look at it and
discovered that hidden in the browser was an excellent programming
language. My initial attitudes were based on the initial positioning of
JavaScript by Sun and Netscape. They made many misstatements about
JavaScript in order to avoid positioning JavaScript as a competitor to
Java. Those misstatements continue to echo in the scores of badly
written JavaScript books aimed at the dummies and amateurs market.</p>
<p></p>
<h1>History</h1>
<p><a href="http://java.sun.com/pr/1995/12/pr951204-03.html">JavaScript</a> was developed by Brendan Eich
at <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a>
as the in-page scripting language
for <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/security/bugbounty.html">Navigator
2</a>. It is a remarkably expressive dynamic programming language.
Because of its linkage to web browsers, it instantly became massively
popular. It never got a trial period in which it could be corrected
and polished based on actual use. The language is powerful and
flawed.</p>
<p>This document describes ECMAScript Edition 3 (aka JavaScript 1.5).
Microsoft and Netscape are developing a static revision which does
not correct the language's flaws. That new language is not JavaScript and  is beyond the
scope of this document.</p>
<h1>Data Types</h1>
<p>JavaScript contains a small set of data types. It has the three
primitive types <i>boolean</i>, <i>number</i>, and <i>string</i> and
the special
values <tt>null</tt> and <tt>undefined</tt>.
Everything else is variations on the <i>object</i> type.</p>
<p>Boolean has two
values: <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>.</p>
<p>Number is 64-bit floating point, similar to
Java's <tt>double</tt> and <tt>Double</tt>.
There is no integer type.  Division between two
integers may produce a fractional result. Number also includes
the special values <tt>NaN</tt> (not a number) and
<tt>Infinity</tt>.</p>
<p>String is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. There is
no separate character type. A character is represented as a string of
length 1. Literal strings are quoted using the<tt> '
</tt>or<tt> " </tt> characters. The quote
characters can be used interchangeably, but they have to match.</p>
<pre class="js">'This is a string.'</pre>
<pre class="js">"Isn't this a string? Yes!"</pre>
<pre class="js">'A' // The character A</pre>
<pre class="js">"" // An empty string</pre>
<p>Escapement is done with the <tt>\</tt>
character, like in Java. Strings are immutable. Strings have
a <tt>length</tt>
member which is used to determine the number of characters in the
string.</p>
<pre>var s = "Hello World!";
s.length == 12</pre>
<p>It is possible to  add methods to the simple types. So, for example, you can add an <tt>int()</tt> method to all numbers, so that <tt>Math.PI.int()</tt> produces <tt>3</tt>.</p>
<p>An implementation may provide other types, such as Dates and
Regular Expressions, but these are really just objects. Everything
else is just objects.</p>
<h2 class="major">Objects</h2>
<p>JavaScript has very nice notational conveniences for manipulating hashtables. </p>
<pre>var myHashtable = {};</pre>
<p>This statement makes a new hashtable and assigns it to a new local
variable. JavaScript is loosely typed, so we don't use type names in
declarations. We use subscript notation to add, replace, or retrieve
elements in the hashtable.</p>
<pre>myHashtable["name"] = "Carl Hollywood";</pre>
<p>There is also a dot notation which is a little more convenient.</p>
<pre>myHashtable.city = "Anytown";</pre>
<p>The dot notation can be used when the subscript is a string constant in the form of a legal identifier.  Because
of an error in the language definition, reserved words cannot be used
in the dot notation, but they can be used in the subscript notation.</p>
<p>You can see that JavaScript's hashtable notation is very similar to
Java's object and array notations. JavaScript takes this much farther:
objects and hashtables are the same thing, so I could have written</p>
<pre>var myHashtable = new Object();</pre>
<p>and the result would have been exactly the same.</p>
<p>There is an enumeration capability built into the <tt>for</tt> statement.</p>
<pre>for (var n in myHashtable) {
    if (myHashtable.hasOwnProperty(n)) {
        document.writeln("&lt;p&gt;" + n + ": " + myHashtable[n] + "&lt;/p&gt;");
    }
}</pre>
<p>The result will be</p>
<pre>&lt;p&gt;name: Carl Hollywood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;city: Anytown&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p>An object is a referenceable container of name/value pairs. The
names are strings (or other elements such as numbers that are
converted to strings). The values can be any of the data types,
including other objects. Objects are usually implemented as
hash-tables, but none of the hash-table nature (such as hash
functions or rehashing methods) is visible.</p>
<p>Objects can easily be nested inside of other objects, and
expressions can reach into the inner objects.</p>
<pre>this.div = document.body.children[document.body.children.length - 1];</pre>
<p>In the object literal notation, an object description is a set of
comma-separated name/value pairs inside curly braces. The names can
be identifiers or strings followed by a colon.  Because
of an error in the language definition, reserved words cannot be used
in the identifier form, but they can be used in the string form. The values can be literals or expressions of any type.</p>
<pre>var myObject = {name: "Jack B. Nimble", 'goto': 'Jail', grade: 'A', level: 3};</pre>
<pre>return {
    event: event,
    op: event.type,
    to: event.srcElement,
    x: event.clientX + document.body.scrollLeft,
    y: event.clientY + document.body.scrollTop};
</pre>
<pre>emptyObject = {};</pre>
<p>JavaScript's object literals are the basis of the <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> 
  data interchange format.</p>
<p>New members can be added to any object at any time by assignment.</p>
<pre>myObject.nickname = 'Jackie the Bee';</pre>
<p>Arrays and functions are implemented as objects.</p>
<h2 class="major">Arrays</h2>
<p>Arrays in JavaScript are also hashtable objects. This makes them
very well suited to sparse array applications. When you construct an
array, you do not need to declare a size. Arrays grow automatically,
much like Java vectors. The values are located by a key, not by an
offset. This makes
JavaScript arrays very convenient to use, but not well suited for
applications in numerical analysis.</p>
<p>The main difference between objects and arrays is the <tt>length</tt> property. The <tt>length</tt> property is always 1 larger than the largest integer key in the array. There are two ways to make a new array:</p>
<pre>var myArray = [];
var myArray = new Array();
</pre>
<p>Arrays are not typed. They can contain numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, and arrays.You can mix strings and
  numbers and objects in the same array. You can use arrays as general nested
  sequences, much as s-expressions. The first index in an array is usually
  zero.</p>
<p>When a new item
is added to an array and the subscript is an integer that is larger than the
current value of <tt>length</tt>,
then the <tt>length</tt> is changed to the
subscript plus one. This is a convenience feature that makes it easy
to use a <tt>for</tt> loop to go through the
elements of an array.</p>
<p>Arrays have a literal notation, similar to that for objects.</p>
<pre>myList = ['oats', 'peas', 'beans', 'barley'];

emptyArray = [];

month_lengths = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];

slides = [
    {url: 'slide0001.html', title: 'Looking&nbsp;Ahead'},
    {url: 'slide0008.html', title: 'Forecast'},
    {url: 'slide0021.html', title: 'Summary'}
];
</pre>
<p>A new item can be added to an array by assignment.</p>
<pre>a[i + j] = f(a[i], a[j]);</pre>
<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Functions in JavaScript look like C functions, except that they are declared with the <tt>function</tt>
keyword instead of a type. When calling a function, it is not required
that you pass a fixed number of parameters. Excess parameters are
ignored. Missing parameters are given the value <tt>undefined</tt>. This makes it easy to write functions that deal with optional arguments.</p>
<p>A function has access to an <tt>arguments</tt> array. It contains
all of the parameters that were actually sent by the caller. It makes
it easy to deal with functions taking a variable number of arguments.
For example,</p>
<pre>function sum() {  // Take any number of parameters and return the sum
    var total = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; ++i) {
        total += arguments[i];
    }
    return total;
}</pre>
<p>JavaScript has inner functions, which serve the same purpose as
inner classes in Java, but are much lighter. JavaScript also has
anonymous functions, which act as lambda expressions.
Functions have lexical scoping. </p>
<p>Functions are first class objects in JavaScript. That means that
they can be stored in objects and passed as arguments to functions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>There are three notations for defining functions: function
statement, function operator, and function constructor.</p>
<h3>Function statement</h3>
<p>The function statement creates a named function within the current
scope.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>function </tt><i>name</i><tt>(</tt><i>argumentlist</i><tt>)</tt>
   <i>block</i>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Functions can be nested. See Closures. An <i>argumentlist</i> is
zero or more argument names, separated with commas. A <i>block</i> is
a list of zero or more statements enclosed in <tt>{
}</tt>.</p>
<p>The function statement is a shorthand for the function operator
form:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>var </tt><i>name</i><tt>
   = function </tt><i>name</i><tt> (</tt><i>argumentlist</i><tt>)
</tt><i>block</i><tt> ;</tt>

</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Function operator</h3>
<p>The function operator is a prefix operator that produces a
function object. It looks similar to the function statement.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>function </tt><i>name</i><tt>(</tt><i>argumentlist</i><tt>)</tt>
   <i>block</i>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>name</i> is optional. If it is provided, then it can be used by the
  function body to call itself recursively. It can also be used to access the
  function's object members  (except on IE). If the
  name is omitted, then it is an anonymous function.</p>
<p>The function operator is commonly used to assign functions to a
prototype.</p>
<p>The function operator can also be used to define functions
in-place, which is handy when writing callbacks.</p>
<h3>Function constructor</h3>
<p>The function constructor takes strings containing the arguments
and body, and produces a function object.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>new Function(</tt><i>strings</i>...<tt>)</tt>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do not use this form. The quoting conventions of the language
make it very difficult to correctly express a function body as a
string. In the string form, early error checking cannot be done. It
is slow because the compiler must be invoked every time the
constructor is called. And it is wasteful of memory because each
function requires its own independent implementation.</p>
<h2>Objects and <tt>this</tt></h2>
<p>A function is an object. It can contain members just as other objects. 
  This allows a function to contain its own data tables. It also allows 
  an object to act as a <i>class</i>, containing a constructor and a set 
  of related methods.</p>
<p>A function can be a member of an object. When a function is a
member of an object, it is called a <i>method</i>. There is a special
variable, called <tt>this</tt> that is set to the
object when a method of the object is called.</p>
<p>For example, in the expression <tt>foo.bar()</tt>,
the <tt> this</tt> variable is set to the object <tt>foo</tt>
as a sort of extra argument for the function <tt>bar</tt>.
The function <tt>bar</tt> can then refer to <tt>this</tt>
to access the object of interest.</p>
<p>In a deeper expression like <tt>do.re.mi.fa()</tt>,
the <tt>this</tt> variable is set to the object <tt>do.re.mi</tt>,
not to the object <tt>do</tt>. In a simple
function call, <tt> this</tt> is set to the Global
Object (aka <tt>window</tt>), which is not very
useful.  The correct behavior should have been
to preserve the current value of <tt>this</tt>,
particularly when calling inner functions.</p>
<h2>Constructor</h2>
<p>Functions which are used to initialize objects are called
<i>constructors</i>. The calling sequence for a constructor is
slightly different than for ordinary functions. A constructor is
called with the <tt>new</tt> prefix:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><tt>new </tt><i>Constructor</i><tt>(</tt><i>parameters...</i><tt>)</tt> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>By convention, the name of a constructor is written with an
initial capital.</p>
<p>The <tt>new</tt> prefix changes the meaning of
the <tt>this</tt> variable. Instead of its usual
value, <tt>this</tt> will be the new object. The
body of the constructor function will usually initialize the object's
members. The constructor will return the new object, unless
explicitly overridden with the <tt>return</tt>
statement.</p>
<p>The constructed object will contain a secret prototype link field, which contains
  a reference to the constructor's <tt>prototype</tt> member.</p>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>Objects contain a hidden link property. This link points to the <tt>prototype</tt>
member of the constructor of the object.</p>
<p>When items are accessed from an object by the dot notation or the
subscript notation, if the item is not found in the object then the
link object is examined. If it is not found in the link object, and if the link object
itself has a link object, then that link object is examined. If the
chain of link objects is exhausted, then <tt>undefined</tt>
is returned.</p>
<p>This use of prototype link chains provides a sort of
inheritance.</p>
<p>Members can be added to the <tt>prototype</tt> by assignment. Here we
define a new class <tt>Demo</tt>, which inherits from class <tt>Ancestor</tt>, and adds
its own method <tt>foo</tt>.</p>
<pre>function Demo() {}
Demo.prototype = new Ancestor();
Demo.prototype.foo = function () {};</pre>
<h2>Vars</h2>
<p>Named variables are defined with the <tt>var</tt>
statement. When used inside of a function, <tt>var</tt>
defines variables with <i>function-scope</i>. The vars are not accessible
from outside of the function. There is no other granularity of scope
in JavaScript. In particular, there is no <i>block-scope</i>.</p>
<p>Any variables used in a function which are not explicitly defined
as <tt>var</tt> are assumed to belong to an outer
scope, possibly to the Global Object.</p>
<p>Vars which are not explicitly initialized are given the value <tt>undefined</tt>.</p>
<p>Vars are not typed. A var can contain a reference to an object, or
a string or a number or a boolean or <tt>null</tt>
or <tt>undefined</tt>.</p>
<p>A new set of vars is made every time the function is called. This allows functions 
  to be recursive.</p>
<h2>Closure</h2>
<p>Functions can be defined inside of other functions. The inner
function has access to the vars and parameters of the outer function. If a reference
to an inner function survives (for example, as a callback function),
the outer function's vars also survive.</p>
<h2>Return</h2>
<p>JavaScript does not have a <tt>void</tt> type,
so every function must return a value. The default value is <tt>undefined</tt>,
except for constructors, where the default return value is <tt>this</tt>.</p>
<h1>Statements</h1>
<p>The set of named statements includes <tt>var</tt>,
<tt>if</tt>, <tt>switch</tt>, <tt>for</tt>,
<tt>while</tt>, <tt>do</tt>, <tt>break</tt>,
<tt>continue</tt>, <tt>return</tt>,
<tt>try</tt>, <tt>throw</tt>,
and <tt>with</tt>. Most of them work the same as
in other C-like languages.</p>
<p>The <tt>var</tt> statement is a list of one or
more variables names, separated by commas, with optional
initialization expressions.</p>
<pre>var a, b = window.document.body;</pre>
<p>If the <tt>var</tt> statement appears outside
of any function, it adds members to the Global Object. If it appears
inside of a function, it defines local variables of the function.</p>
<p>In <tt>if</tt> statements, <tt>while</tt>
statements, <tt>do</tt> statements, and logical
operators, JavaScript treats <tt>false</tt>, <tt>null</tt>,
<tt>undefined</tt>, <tt>""</tt>
(the empty string), and the number <tt>0</tt> as
false. All other values are treated as <tt>true</tt>.</p>
<p>The <tt>case</tt> labels in a <tt>switch</tt>
statement can be expressions. They don't have to be constants. They can be strings.</p>
<p>There are two forms of the <tt>for</tt> statement. The first is the common 
  <code>(</code><var>init</var><code>;</code> <var>test</var><code>;</code> 
  <var>inc</var><code>)</code> form. The second is an object iterator.</p>
<pre>for (name in object) {
    if (object.hasOwnProperty(name)) {
        value = object[name];
    }
}</pre>
<p>The block is executed for each <tt>name</tt> in
the <tt>object</tt>. The order in which the names
are produced is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Statements can have a label prefix, which is an identifier
followed with a colon.</p>
<p>The <tt><a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/04/11/with-statement-considered-harmful/">with</a></tt><a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/04/11/with-statement-considered-harmful/"> 
  statement</a> should not be used.</p>
<h1>Operators</h1>
<p>JavaScript has a fairly large set of operators. Most of them work
the same way as in other C-like languages. There are a few
differences to watch out for.</p>
<p>The <tt>+</tt> operator is used for both addition and concatenation. If
either of the operands is a string, it concatenates. This
can cause errors. For example, <tt>'$' + 3 +
4</tt> produces <tt>'$34'</tt>, not <tt>'$7'</tt>.</p>
<p><tt>+</tt> can be used as a prefix operator,
converting its string operand to a number.</p>
<p><tt>!!</tt> can be used as a prefix operator, converting its operand to a boolean.</p>
<p>The <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> operator is commonly
called <i>logical and</i>. It can also be called <i>guard</i>. If the
first operand is <tt>false</tt>, <tt>null</tt>,
<tt>undefined</tt>, <tt>""</tt> (the
empty string), or the number <tt>0</tt> then
it returns the first operand. Otherwise, it returns the second
operand. This provides a convenient way to write a null-check:</p>
<pre>var value = p &amp;&amp; p.name; /* The name value will
only be retrieved from p if p has a value, avoiding an error. */</pre>
<p>The <tt>||</tt> operator is commonly called
<i>logical or</i>. It can also be called <i>default</i>. If the first
operand is <tt>false</tt>, <tt>null</tt>,
<tt>undefined</tt>, <tt>""</tt> (the
empty string), or the number <tt>0</tt>, then
it returns the second operand. Otherwise, it returns the first
operand. This provides a convenient way to specify default
values:</p>
<pre>value = v || 10; /* Use the value of v, but if v
doesn't have a value, use 10 instead. */</pre>
<p>JavaScript supplies a set of bitwise and shift operators, but does
not have an Integer type to apply them to. What happens is the Number
operand (a 64-bit floating-point number) is converted to a 32-bit
integer before the operation, and then converted back to floating
point after the operation.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, <tt>void</tt> is a prefix
operator, not a type. It always returns <tt>undefined</tt>.
This has very little value. I only mention it in case you accidently
type <tt>void</tt> out of habit and are puzzled by
the strange behavior.</p>
<p>The <tt>typeof</tt> operator returns a string
based on the type of its operand.</p>

<h1>Potpourri</h1>
<h2>Global Object</h2>
<p>The Global Object is the keeper of all of the functions and
variables which were not defined inside of other functions and
objects. Surprisingly, the Global Object does not have an explicit
name in the language. Sometimes the <tt>this</tt>
variable points at it, but often not. In the web browsers, <tt>window</tt>
and <tt>self</tt> are members of the Global Object
which point to the Global Object, thus giving an indirect way of
addressing it.</p>
<p>If a variable is accessed, but is not found in the current scope,
it is looked for in the Global Object. If it is not found there, an
error will result.</p>
<p>The ECMAScript specification does not talk about the possibility
of multiple Global Objects, or <i>contexts</i>, but browsers support
this. Each window has its own Global Object.</p>
<h2>Semicolon Insertion</h2>
<p>One of the mistakes in the language is semicolon insertion. This
is a technique for making semicolons optional as statement
terminators. It is reasonable for IDEs and shell programs to do
semicolon insertion. It is not reasonable for the language definition
to require compilers to do it. Use semicolons.</p>
<h2>Reserved Words</h2>
<p>JavaScript is very heavy handed in its restrictions on reserved
words. The reserved words are</p>
<blockquote><tt>abstract<br>
   boolean <b>break</b> byte<br>
   <b>case</b> <b>catch</b> char class const <b>continue</b><br>
   debugger <b>default</b> <b>delete</b> <b>do</b> double<br>
   <b>else</b> enum export extends<br>
   <b>false</b> final <b>finally</b> float <b>for</b> <b>function</b><br>
   goto<br>
   <b>if</b> implements import <b>in</b> <b>instanceof</b> int
   interface<br>
   long<br>
   native <b>new null</b><br>
   package private protected public<br>
   <b>return</b><br>
   short static super <b>switch</b> synchronized<br>
   <b>this</b> <b>throw</b> throws transient <b>true try</b>
   <b>typeof</b><br>
   <b>var</b> volatile <b>void</b><br>
   <b>while</b> <b>with</b></tt></blockquote>
<p>Most of those words are not even used in the language. A reserved
word cannot be used</p>
<ol>

  <li>As a name in literal object notation</li>
  <li>As a member name in dot notation</li>
  <li>As a function argument</li>
  <li>As a <tt>var</tt></li>
  <li>As an unqualified global variable</li>
  <li>As a statement label</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no excuse for the first two restrictions. None. There is
an excuse for the second two restrictions, but it is very weak.</p>
